# Covid-19 Analysis - Power BI

## Overview

This project involves analyzing the Covid-19 dataset using Power BI. The dataset contains Covid-19 statistics from various countries across the globe. It includes data such as the number of confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and active cases over time. The goal of this analysis is to visualize global Covid-19 trends, compare different countries, and extract meaningful insights from the data.

## Dataset Used

The dataset used for this project is from Kaggle, available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imdevskp/corona-virus-report). It includes the following key fields:

- **Date**: The date when the data was reported.
- **Country**: The country or region to which the data corresponds.
- **Confirmed**: Total confirmed Covid-19 cases.
- **Deaths**: Total deaths caused by Covid-19.
- **Recovered**: Total recoveries from Covid-19.
- **Active**: Total active Covid-19 cases.
- **New cases**: Newly confirmed cases for that day.
- **New deaths**: Newly recorded deaths for that day.
- **Population**: Population of the country.

## Analysis Performed

The dataset was analyzed using Power BI, and the following steps were performed:

1. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**:
   - Removed unnecessary columns.
   - Converted date and numeric fields to appropriate data types.
   - Handled missing data and filled or removed null values.
   - Created additional columns like **Active Cases** and **Death Rate**.

2. **Trend Analysis**:
   - Visualized the daily trends of confirmed, recovered, and death cases over time for global and country-level insights.
   - Analyzed the growth of new cases and new deaths over different periods (daily, weekly, etc.).

3. **Comparative Analysis**:
   - Compared countries based on the total confirmed cases, total deaths, and active cases.
   - Analyzed the death rate and recovery rate for each country, comparing countries with the highest and lowest rates.

4. **Geographical Distribution**:
   - Created map visualizations to show the distribution of Covid-19 cases around the world.
   - Used color coding to highlight regions with the highest and lowest case numbers.

5. **Key Metrics Calculation**:
   - Calculated metrics like the **death rate** and **recovery rate** for each country using the formula:
     - **Death Rate = (Deaths / Confirmed) * 100**
     - **Recovery Rate = (Recovered / Confirmed) * 100**

6. **User Interactivity**:
   - Added slicers for countries and time periods to allow users to explore the data dynamically.
   - Enabled tooltips and filtering options to provide detailed insights at a glance.

## Key Findings and Insights

From the visualizations and analysis, the following key insights were drawn:

1. **Global Case Trends**:
   - The global Covid-19 confirmed cases and deaths saw a significant rise in 2020, with fluctuations in 2021. New cases peaked multiple times, especially during the emergence of new variants.
   - The recovery rate globally increased over time, as medical treatments and vaccines were developed.

2. **High-Risk Countries**:
   - Countries such as the **United States**, **Brazil**, and **India** had the highest number of confirmed cases and deaths. These countries also saw high mortality rates.
   - Some countries with smaller populations had higher **death rates** and **case fatality rates**, highlighting the uneven impact of the pandemic.

3. **Death Rate Analysis**:
   - Countries with well-established healthcare systems generally had a lower death rate (e.g., **Germany**, **South Korea**), while countries with strained healthcare infrastructure or lower access to vaccines had higher death rates (e.g., **Mexico**, **Russia**).

4. **Regional Distribution**:
   - The map visualizations revealed that the **United States**, **India**, and **Brazil** had the highest numbers of confirmed cases and deaths, while many countries in **Africa** and **Oceania** had relatively fewer cases.
   - Asia and Europe had varying case numbers, with **Europe** experiencing severe outbreaks in certain waves.

5. **Recovery vs. Active Cases**:
   - Recovery rates varied by country, with some countries achieving a high recovery rate, while others saw a surge in active cases, indicating a high number of ongoing infections.

6. **Trends Over Time**:
   - The dataset revealed clear waves of infections in different periods, with a noticeable drop in new cases and deaths following vaccination campaigns in some countries.
   - The **new case** trends followed the spread of new Covid-19 variants, particularly in 2021.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of Power BI for visualizing and analyzing large datasets like Covid-19 statistics. Through trend analysis, comparative metrics, and geographical distribution, the analysis provides valuable insights into the impact of the pandemic on a global scale, as well as highlighting key countries and regions that faced the most severe effects. The interactive nature of the Power BI report allows users to explore the data and draw their own conclusions based on different parameters.
